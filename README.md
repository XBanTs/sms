MAKE SURE TO CHECK OUT 'HOW TO LAUNCH APPLICATION' FILE

I developed this project using the following:

XAMPP as my local webserver
PHP Language
MySQL Database
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
jQuery
Ajax
Bootstrap
AdminLTE
and some other plugins/libraries.
This Stock Management System can be only accessed by 2 types of users which are the System Admins and Staff. The Admin User can access and manage all the pages, forms, and features do the web application does while the Staff Users have limited access only.

The Stock Records such as the Purchase Order, Receiving, etc. in this project have print features for each record. Talking about the flow of this project, first, the admin users must populate all the important lists which are the supplier list and the item list. Next, users will create a Purchase Order Record for a supplier. After that, users can receive the items in each purchase order which means PO Record is required in order to add stock of the item. Then, when receiving the items when the supplier will only deliver some of the items or not complete, the system will automatically create a new Back Order Record for the items that are not delivered yet. BO records work like the Purchase Order Record. Next, when the received items have problems, issues, or etc., the management can create the Return Record and upon saving this file, the system will also automatically deduct the damaged items to the stock availability. Lastly, the sales record is the record of the company for stocks that have been purchased by their clients or customers. Each stock listed in the sales record will also be deducted from the stock availability.
